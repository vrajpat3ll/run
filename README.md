# run

A minimal cli for running a code file without having to worry about deleting the output file.

That's what this is!
You can command ChatGPT to make one yourself.

## Usage

### Windows

- Create a shortcut for the [run.bat](./run.bat) file in this directory.
- Rename the shortcut to `run`.
- Now copy the path of this directory.
- Go to environment variables and add this to your PATH.

### Linux
- Find out yourselves, guys!
I tested this on a Windows machine.

---
Now, you can run almost all single files without ever needing to delete the output files after their use.

I hope you have written the correct extension for the file!
```
run file/to/program.c
run file/to/program.cpp
run file/to/program.py
run file/to/program.js
run file/to/program.go
run file/to/program.bat
run file/to/program.exe
```
Java support to be added soon!# run
